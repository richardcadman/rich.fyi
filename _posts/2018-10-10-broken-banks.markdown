`I try to remove my overdraft on Natwest.`

<br>

## I'm building a bank at Monzo

Full disclaimer, I'm a Product Manager at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/). Monzo's a UK challenger bank that lives on your smartphone, and we currently have over 1m customers.

### We help people use borrowing to achieve their goals

I'm PMing a few squads that help people use borrowing to achieve their goals. There's three pillars to the lending vision:
- Put the user in **control** of their borrowing
- Help the user **feel good** about their borrowing
- Empower the user to **achieve their goals** using borrowing

### Technology should make it easy to put the user in control of their finances

Control matters a lot to me, particularly when it comes to money, and so I'm always on the look out for where we can improve the experience on Monzo.

I don't use my Natwest account as often as I used to, so I thought I'd remove my overdraft for peace of mind (largely to avoid hidden charges) and to compare the process to ours.

## Removing an overdraft with Natwest

### 1. You'll need a computer, 10mins, and perseverance  

![overdrafts](/assets/img/natwest/natwest_two_overdrafts.png){:class="img-responsive"}

- I'm set up for mobile banking - fingerprint login takes seconds - and so I thought I'd be able to remove my overdraft on my mobile (spoiler: you can't)
- I then logged in online and tried to go about removing my overdraft, by clicking on 'overdrafts'.
- I'm taken to a pop up window, where the options are fairly clear, I want to _change an existing overdraft_
- I'm taken to another page, where I click on _remove an overdraft_

Things get a bit funnier now.

### 2. You can't actually guarantee you'll avoid charges

- Even if I remove my overdraft, I'm told that I can still go overdrawn
- If I go overdrawn without an 'arranged overdraft' I'll actually get stung with loads of fees
- I don't understand why Natwest will let me go overdrawn unless I've set up an overdraft (unless it's an offline transaction, I don't see why this should happen)

### 3. You'll need to apply for an overdraft again

![overdrafts](/assets/img/natwest/natwest_five_process.png){:class="img-responsive"}

- To remove the overdraft I'm told I need to 'apply for an overdraft again' (why?)
- This will be actioned by Natwest _as soon as they can_

### 4. You'll need a third browser window

- Continuing on my mission, I now get a third popup window (aaghh)
- This walks me through the process of 'opening an account' (reminder - I'm trying to remove an overdraft)
- Thumbs up for accessibility though

![overdrafts](/assets/img/natwest/natwest_eight_threesteps.png){:class="img-responsive"}
- I trundle through three pages asking me to confirm info, including my last three addresses (why?)

### 5. You'll need resilience (after all that, it errors)

- 10mins later my world ends


### 6. Removing an overdraft isn't instantaneous

- After beating the error (I tried again later)
- I'm told my request will be actioned soon

### 7. The confirmation is complex, and mistimed
- A day or so later I get an email that invites me to log back in and view the results of my overdraft application
- I check in my app whether the overdraft has been removed (it hasn't yet)
