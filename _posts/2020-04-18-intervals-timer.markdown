`Interval timer: my first time using Figma`

I consider myself decent at service design, and designing good user experiences. I consider myself very poor at UI. So I wanted to give it a quick blast this weekend using Figma (apparently the trendy option for designers these days).

An interval timer helps you do high intensity training. Typically you either run a set distance or time at a fast pace, and then a subsequent set distance or time at a much slower pace.

The premise of the app is simple: configure your interval periods - for both sprinting and resting - pick how many sets you want to do, and check the total time is what you expect. Hit go, and the app guides you through your workout. Green indicates a rest period, and red indicates you should get a shift on. All your key stats sit below.
