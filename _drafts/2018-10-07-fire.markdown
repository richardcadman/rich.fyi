`Getting to grips with the concept of being financially independent and retiring early`

### Core principles

The main ideas behind FIRE are:
1. **Develop philosophies that enable frugality** - have a comprehensive set of philosophies that align with frugal living (e.g. anti-consumerism, rent rather than own, repair rather than replace, experiences rather than things, living close to work, cycle or walk everywhere, etc).. note the difference between _being frugal_ and _developing philosophies on life that result in frugality_ (the former is unlikely to be particularly enjoyable, or sustainable)
2. **Have a dramatically low expense:income ratio** - as a product of your philosophies, dramatically lower your expenses as a proportion of income
3. **Build a big pot of money** - quickly amass a large pot of money (bonus if you can ramp up your salary and avoid lifestyle drift)
4. **Invest and benefit from compound interest** - invest the money in a market (usually via a low-cost index fund) with decent returns, benefit from compound interest
5. **Live off the investment returns with a safe withdrawal rate** - at some point your pot of money gets large enough, and your expenses low enough, that you can withdraw enough to live on and yet the pot won't deplete (due to the investment gains ~= the withdrawals)

You're then financially independent, and can retire early if you want (FIRE).

### Before you start

Before you FIRE, you should understand your top priorities. I.e. get the basic stuff in place like paying down massive loans order before you worry about optimising your portfolio.

### 1) FIRE Philosophies
- Get more intentional with your life, question your choices
- Be aware of the impact of your decisions (e.g. that subscription now could be ~ Â£3k extra of work = a few more months)

### 2) Low expense:income ratio
- Not everyone does this, consideration of LeanFIRE vs FatFIRE

### 3) Build

- Up your salary and/or lower your spend

### 4) Invest

- Low cost index funds to get you going
- Dollar cost averaging

### 5) Withdraw

#### When have you got enough money to retire
- 4% rule (+ debunking a bit)

#### What to do with your life after

- Idea that you don't give up working, you're just freed up a bit

### Calculators

You want to be sure you won't run out of money, here's two methods for increasing confidence:

- [Chance of your retirement pot lasting til the end](https://www.firecalc.com/index.php), based on historical performance of the S&P500 from the last 200+ years.
- [Chance of your retirement pot lasting til the end](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dc0ohv6m8PiVPJl5zc47I-JFnD5fjnF7Q0c6pPHPEv4/edit), based on a Monte Carlo simulation (i.e. randomised market returns). This gets slated a bit as years aren't necessarily independent from each other.

[This blog](https://www.sensiblemoney.com/learn/3-ways-to-tell-if-your-retirement-income-plan-will-work/) gives a good overview of the methods.

### Key Risks

Obviously all these revolve around running out of money, but with different root causes:
- Problem: Ill health, meaning I need to
- Solution:
- Problem: Government decides to raid ISAs and pensions
- Problem: Decoupling of interest rates and inflation
- Problem: Interest rates tank
- Problem: Stock market dives and doesn't follow historical trends
- Problem:
